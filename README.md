## Name

A To-do application

## Description

This Project is focused on developing a To-do software application that lets a user make a list of tasks that they need to complete. Daily or weekly lists of tasks can be made. The app should let the user keep track of their chores and tasks should be marked completed when they have been accomplished. The list should then be updated. The user has to first set up an account and let him/her keep track of the chores to be done. The specific date and time that the user should be reminded is set and a remainder through email sent. The email should contain a link to the task, which opens when clicked. Tasks that are incomplete but whose time has passed should be marked as skipped. The user can delete tasks. All tasks should not be stored for more than seven days

## Visuals

To be uploaded soon.

## Installation

A Django framework will be used to develop the back-end system. A minimal web application will be built using tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the front end. Extreme Programming (XP) will be used to produce higher quality software and higher quality of life for the team
